**Final 21 school project.**

The idea of the project is to rewrite the famous game **Core Wars**.

All terms and descriptions of the game you can find on Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War).

In simple words, the project consists of the following parts:

- **The assembly**, a guy, which translates the assembler code of players into bytecode.
- **The game board**, or the virtual machine. The memory of our virtual computer. Itâ€™s represented in a 64 X 64 grid of bytes.
- **The players**, small programs. The white parts have blank memory.

## Okay, here we go

So, first tou need to "prepare" the player for your(ours) Virtual Machine.

You can find all the players in **champs** folder.

For example, here is a player called [Batman.s](champs/Batman.s).
